\section{Implementation}
\label{section:implementation}
A Naive Bayes classifier was implemented in Node.js \cite{node}, as a simple module with the ability to \texttt{train}
and \texttt{classify} on text, as well as some debugging interfaces such as \texttt{dump} and \texttt{restore}. This
core logic is exposed via a convenient CLI tool, which can be run locally from this project or downloaded from the
public node package manager (NPM) \cite{rdn-naive-bayes}.
