\section{Implementation}
\label{section:implementation}
A Naive Bayes classifier was implemented in Node.js \cite{node}, as a simple module with the ability to \texttt{train}
and \texttt{classify} on text, as well as some debugging interfaces such as \texttt{dump} and \texttt{restore}. This
core logic is exposed via a convenient CLI tool, which can be run locally from this project or downloaded from the
public node package manager (NPM) \cite{rdn-naive-bayes}. This CLI tool simply wraps the core Naive Bayes Classifier
with some scripting logic to process downloaded datasets of varying formats,
described below in \ref{subsection:datasets}.

\subsection{Training the Classifier}
\label{subsection:training}
Much of the work for Naive Bayes Classification takes place when training, rather than when classifying. True to this,
most of the business logic in this project resides in the \texttt{train} method
