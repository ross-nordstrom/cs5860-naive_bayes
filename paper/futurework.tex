As with all machine learning techniques, many hours or even days could be spent fine-tuning the data normalization,
tokenizing, and parameterization of the naive bayes classifier implemented here.

Some key things that should be investigated to improve this classifier include generalizing the tokenizer concept
to support regression feature (such as ``avg word length = 4.5"), normalize the token counts across classes (this is
what likely had the largest impact on the success of this report's results), and investigate new ways to tokenize.
